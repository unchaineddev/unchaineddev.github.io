      <description>I like archiving files and directories, mostly due to local storage constraints. Creating backups of files and saving them in tarballs or 7zips has become second nature to me. However I have realized I have been doing it wrong all along. I&amp;rsquo;ve predominantly relied on GUI methods, only to discover that the command line method is so straightforward that even a caveman could do it.
This is a short note for me, and for you in case you would want to compress or extract archived files using the command line.</description>
