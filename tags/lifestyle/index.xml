      <title>Keeping Pictures</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/keeping-pictures/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember, I hated the idea of keeping old pictures. I have
always found myself deleting them like bad memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where marketing and physical appearance reign supreme, I shied away
from keeping pictures in my adolescent years. My insecurities often kept me
from embracing moments, making me uncomfortable whenever someone wanted to take
a picture with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this worsened from the profound impact of social media in my life.
With great severity, big tech companies were aggressively pushing their apps on
our faces during that period. It was truly overwhelming. Falling victim to such
a phenomenon feels more or less being enslaved. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat,
Twitter: these are apps which you do not really need in your day-to-day life. I
have come to realize they thrive on your insecurities. Nonetheless, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this unusual philosophy about pictures. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I picked it
from — maybe something I read or heard, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I can be a bit
philosophical &lt;del&gt;sometimes&lt;/del&gt;, you know. The idea centered around &lt;em&gt;complete focus
on the moment itself, rather than documenting it&lt;/em&gt;. Extending to this idea,
there was another that suggested &lt;em&gt;great memories are those deeply etched in
your mind, something you can look back on and feel, rather than just see in the
form of media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing as I write this and reflect on the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a
strange habit: I find myself meticulously organizing my pictures in different
folders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Letters From A Stoic</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/letters-from-a-stoic/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;This post contains letters from &lt;em&gt;Seneca&lt;/em&gt;, a Stoic philosopher of Ancient Rome,
and my thoughts on his philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Stoicism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Stoics identified the path to achieving it
[ good spirit ] with a life spent practicing the four virtues in everyday life:
&lt;br&gt;
     wisdom, courage, temperance or moderation, and
justice, and living in accordance with nature. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letter II&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;letter-ii&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#letter-ii&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/book.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400px&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seneca&amp;rsquo;s second letter is addressed to Lucilius, emphasising significance of
settling one&amp;rsquo;s self and deriving joy from solitude. He advises against
consuming books from different authors, instead &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;focusing on authors whose
genius is unquestionable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would slightly disagree with him on this point. There is no doubt genius
writers would have a great effect on one&amp;rsquo;s mind, however you cannot ignore the
impact of the human experience. If you are reading something not-so-genius but
you learn a valuable lesson from it, I would argue it would be a wise choice.
While Seneca&amp;rsquo;s analogy of a wound not healing if subjected to experiments of
several ointments, or a plant weakening from constant uprooting is compelling,
engaging with a multitude of viewpoints and getting perspective deepens your
understanding of things. With this in mind, I would not say reading a lot of
garbage self-help authors or a bunch of phony writers would do your life any
good. Picking the right authors is without a doubt a good first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seneca also suggests focusing more on the quality than the quantity of books.
This resonates with my philosphy and it is something I really struggle with
sometimes. Whenever I start a book, my heart &lt;strong&gt;wants&lt;/strong&gt; to finish it (as most of
us would like to). However, this is a key point to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;To read that brings pleasure, and to let go of books that cause pain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this knowledge as a shield against life&amp;rsquo;s adversities and cultivate the
habit of resilience is valuable advice. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more with Seneca when
he says, &amp;ldquo;It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who
hankers after more&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letter III&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;letter-iii&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#letter-iii&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the popular proverb, &lt;em&gt;A friend in need is a friend indeed&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this letter, Seneca addresses Lucilius&amp;rsquo;s distrust towards his friend, and
&lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; questions him if he &amp;ldquo;actually&amp;rdquo; called him a friend or if it was
merely out of courtesy. This debate evokes a point in my life, when I stood by
this philosophy of &lt;em&gt;true friendship&lt;/em&gt;. (as ridiculous as it sounds) I reserved
the title of a &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt; with those I shared a deep friendship, while others,
less intimately known, remained acquaintances. The significance of words may be
overlooked in today&amp;rsquo;s world, yet the value words hold must remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/friends.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400px&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, &lt;em&gt;Friendship&lt;/em&gt; is a bond built on trust, where we willingly place our
hearts and souls at our friend&amp;rsquo;s feet, trusting they will not deceive us.
Overcoming fear of betrayal demands reflecting the same trust we have in
ourselves. Seneca offers timeless wisdom on this matter, advising against both
indiscriminately confiding in everyone and keeping secrets from our closest
friends. Certainly judgement must precede freely sharing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seneca believes being busy in life doesn&amp;rsquo;t always equate to productivity,
rather signifies a troubled mind. Likewise, condemning all activity leads to
laziness and not a relaxed mind. He advocates for striking a balance and
suggests looking towards nature for relaxation. Below is a quote I really found
interesting in this letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some men have shrunk so far into dark corners that objects in broad daylight
seem quite blurred to them&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letter V&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;letter-v&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#letter-v&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seneca earnestly approves of those constantly learning, determined for
self-improvement. To be a better man (or woman) is essential, however he warns
against doing it to seek attention, or for solely provoking others through
appearances or ways of living. This is profoundly accurate in an era, dominated
by FAANG mania, Instagram reelz and TikTok trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fascinating how a philosopher born centuries ago accurately describes our
reality. Better yet shares his ideas on how to lead a simple life. Maybe, this
philosophy is deeply rooted in the essence of humanity, passed down through
generations; a promise of belonging to one race, one global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seneca puts this beautifully: &lt;i&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our motto, as one knows, is to live in
conformity with nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some key points I found fascinating in this letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admiring one&amp;rsquo;s way of life, and appreciate the beauty in its simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admire one&amp;rsquo;s character and values, instead of their material possessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seneca also highlights how &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; march in unison &amp;ldquo;like a prisoner
and escort he is handcuffed to&amp;rdquo;. This theme is widely explored, so I would just
like to add how memory brings back the agony of fear, and as philosophical as
it sounds, one must live in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letter VI&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;letter-vi&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#letter-vi&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this letter, Seneca writes to Lucilius that he observes not only
improvement, but also transformation within himself. While humbly admitting his
imperfections, Seneca admits the significance of sharing his feelings with his
friend (as discussed in a previous letter). Additionally, he highlights the
mutual benefit of exchanging insights through shared books. Knowledge is
valuable if shared, useless if held in secret. My philosophy on this remains.
Talking to someone each day and studying their character benefits more than
conversing with someone rarely. More often than not, to be your own friend too
is a wonderful idea of progress, atleast in theory. Nonetheless to share-it-all
with a friend is a priceless benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letter VII&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;letter-vii&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#letter-vii&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world driven through trends, events and content, there is always a chaotic
mind. Though Seneca highlights in this letter that consorting with a mass crowd
is harmful, I beleive mingling with the wrong crowd is far more perilous. It&amp;rsquo;s
often said that one&amp;rsquo;s character is significantly influenced by the five closest
people one associates with. Therefore, it is essential to be picky in that respect.
Someone who improves your character; Someone who you can improve. A process of
mutual improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;A few is enough for me; so is one; and so is none. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Coffee Can Investing - A Review</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/coffee-can-investing/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago; the second best time is now.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly beleive in the eight wonder of the world. It may be common sensical
for someone with good discipline, patience, and consistency that the secret
lies in waiting for the magic to unfold. The only way, my friend is paying the
price: &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This magical reminder comes in a form of a book: Coffee Can Investing by Saurab
Mukherjea and his team, that have created a roadmap that captures the common
pitfalls of a common retail investor. A guide to make wise financial decisions
without compromising on your wants and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend this book to someone who wants to filter out the noise
and focus on the goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt; It may not be necessary for everyone to read the entire book, yet
skimming through to understand the core philosophy should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bengaluru is like a dear friend who gets along really well with anyone. She&amp;rsquo;s
known for her pleasant nature, creative mind, love for greens and hanging out
with people of diverse backgrounds. As someone who has lived with Bengaluru,
like many of us, who deeply value the essence of her character, I would reject
the idea if someone told me our beloved city could a face water crisis or reach
a scorching high temperature of 37 degrees this summer. (again)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we love her as we have seen her &amp;ndash; Grow as a quaint garden city to a
beautiful bustling metropolis. A city crowded by cars and cafes, ignoring the
effects of climate change and urbanization. And now our dear friend is weary. While
her heart beats with a passion for technology and innovation, she longs for a
break from endless development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure her sustainability for years to come, let us recognize her need to
prioritize self-care. Here are a few simple things you can do to nurture your
friendsip with Bengaluru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conserve water by fixing leaks, taking shorter showers, turning off taps when not in use, and using water wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off lights, fans, and electronic devices when not in use to conserve energy and lower utility bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocate for increased tree planting initiatives, and protest against cutting down trees for corporate profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice proper waste management by segregating waste at the source into recyclables and non-recyclables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opt for public transport whenever possible to alleviate carbon emissions and traffic congestion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spread awareness about environmental issues and the importance of sustainability through social media and other mediums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Goals for 2024</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/goals-for-2024/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Looking back at 2023, it makes me realize how quickly time slips through our fingers. It was a wonderful (yet hectic) year for me. I discovered wealth of information and shared eventful experiences with people.
As I stand at the threshold of this new year, I anticipate more promising events and learnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike making new year resolutions due to the psychological inclination of undertaking drastic changes, so I have committed myself to implement small changes for a lasting impact, some of which are follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;🏃🏼‍♂️ Physical Health 🏊🏼‍♂️&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-physical-health-&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-physical-health-&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I covered several kilometers on foot, including my daily walk to work. I spent hours on this activity, although I feel a 20 minute jog this year would be more effective. In addition, I went swimming for a couple of months during the weekends, and I intend on resuming it come summer. Along with this, I wish to induldge in intense physical activities which I would enjoy once a week and improve my sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;🥬 Diet 🥬&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-diet-&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-diet-&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, I faced a severe illness that made me realize how invaluable good health is. Thus, I made a conscious decision to cut down junk food (especially sugar) from my life.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a sweet spot for sugary foods anyway, so it worked out well for me. I will continue to avoid sugary foods, except on special occasions, and have junk-food once a month. I have also adopted the habit of having an early dinner and plan to maintain this practice. &lt;em&gt;Drink More Water than Coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning &amp;amp; Self-Improvement 🧠&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;learning--self-improvement-&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#learning--self-improvement-&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 was a busy year for me, which left little room for leisurely reading. this year I intend to spend more time reading on diverse topics. I read a couple non-fiction novels, and I would be happy to read more non-fiction this year, along with other people&amp;rsquo;s code/poetry/stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python was my go-to language and shall remain so this year. I am sure to get my hands dirty with js and I aim to learn a little bit of Rust too. 🦀
for the longest time I wanted to learn a NoSQL Db such as Mongo, so I am hoping to integrate one project with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at last, I want to self-host a few tools I use and understand Web3 tech. All in all, stay updated with the industry trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn trading and understand the technical aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track and reduce unnecessary expenses and use the money to take up a new hobby and travel to a new place instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch good films, and avoid crappy films as such. Old cinema preferred. duh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover solutions to enhance file management while restructuring repositories on my Github/Gitlab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribute to a few open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write anything and everything. Blog often as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplify complex problems. solve atleast one problem on leetcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>70 Hours per Week</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/70-hours-per-week/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infosys&lt;/em&gt; founder Narayana Murthy recently said that, young Indians must work 70 hours a week. &amp;ndash; a phenomenal recommendation from a prominent capitalist. I respect his achievements but a statement like this makes me want to question his intelligence or, take any of these wise old men seriously. His idea is if you want India to realize its economic potential every young Indian must say: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you do not need to work 70 hours to realize its economic potential.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe he forgot the part where the quality of life also plays a crucial part in economic development? Maybe higher wages would help? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I am no expert. Nonetheless for the sake of argument, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a five-day work week, and subtracting 70 hours for work leaves out 50 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we allocate a bare minimum portion for essential activities like sleeping (averaging 8 hours a day) and meals (1.5 hours a day for three meals), we are left with barely a dozen hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not included commuting, grooming or leisure time for that matter. it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to acknowledge that quality of life plays a significant role in economic development, which Murthy happily chose to ignore in his statement. Merely advocating for longer work hours without addressing other factors undermines overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the nationalist angle is ridiculous. for the sake of India, you cannot work 14 hours a day? Oh come on?! Where&amp;rsquo;s all the energy draining? Don&amp;rsquo;t you tell me you are working two jobs?? Oh right, that&amp;rsquo;s called moonlighting. &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/em&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/infosys-warns-employees-on-moonlighting-says-could-lead-to-termination/articleshow/94169072.cms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;unethical&lt;/a&gt;! You can only slog for us, because we are a big company and
you are our &lt;em&gt;modern slave&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
