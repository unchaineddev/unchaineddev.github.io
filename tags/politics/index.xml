      <description>All the big news organizations from the west brainwash you and twist facts about everything. If you think there are not taking a side or there are no biases, you are giving them the benefit of the doubt.
You can never trust a for-profit big news organization, for they are more concerned about their political or social agenda; It&amp;rsquo;s a no-brainer.
Their support for Israel is clear that they are just ignorant of a simple fact that more civilians are killed by Israel.</description>
