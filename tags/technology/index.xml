      <title>Indus App Store</title>

         alt=&#34;indus app store&#34; width=&#34;600px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phonepe launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indusappstore.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Indus App Store&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to the Google Play Store.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it a revolutionary product per se, as phone manufacturers already bundle their own app stores on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good news for developers though, as there is 0% commission on in-app subscriptions and low fees in comparison to the Google Play Store.
As a consumer, to use Indus App Store since it is a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make in India&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; product does not cut it for me.
I avoid Samsung Galaxy Store, and God Forbid if I use Xiaomi GetApps out of despair; Similarly Indus lacks a compelling reason for anyone
to go through the installing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a competing market it is a better alternative albeit with a caveat. Indus App Store can be better than GetApps, Galaxy Store,
or even Google Play Store if the company conducts thorough and rigorous security checks before allowing apps into their app store.
Executing this task is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming they do capture a significant market share from Google, it would be difficult
for them to screen millions of apps. After all, a tech giant like Google itself suffers from this same problem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Furthermore, being a for-profit, their focus shifts more towards generating revenue than security of the platform anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another primary challenge for Indus is convince users to install their app. If it fails, I am assuming they would bundle it as a pre-installed app,
which I would consider bloatware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indus may be the alternative you are looking for if you want to steer clear from Google, however if I had to install something on my own, I would
install &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;F-droid&lt;/a&gt; as it is free and open-source, that is developed and maintained by a transparent community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Using Whatsapp</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/stop-using-whatsapp/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to go against what is a lost cause. To tell someone to stop using whatsapp
in India is like ripping off their right to communicate freely. Nobody cares about privacy around here.
If someone likes me tells them their favorite messaging app is invasive, they tend to prompt questions that
imply I may have something to hide. Well in truth, Whatsapp is a closed-source, zuckbook-backed, data-mining company,
which in many ways is compromised. With this in mind, you cannot argue that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy
and it is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Snowden said it best: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Arguing that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy becaue you have nothing to hide is no different
than saying you don&amp;rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is worse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://whatsapp.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/a&gt; falsely claims to be a private messaging app, providing &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;end-to-end encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
to your messages. In reality, Whatsapp moderators&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; can read your messages, and they love to share your metadata
with law enforcement and other third-party companies, not only because it has to comply, or earn a profit, but to build
a relationship map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relationship map is an identity that can be derived from just who you associate with, which basically just
cancels out the encryption and privacy claim. One could argue that the constant lies is the problem, but you
need to ask yourself, if whatsapp was a person, would you trust it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun fact: The Zuck himself does not use whatsapp. Yet we Indians are accustomed to
&lt;em&gt;Good Morning&lt;/em&gt; texts and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;forwards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; that our minds have become numb, like the lizard person dumb
founded by gathering all that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree it is hard to break loose from this dopamine induced eco-system. After all, the primary reason why
people can&amp;rsquo;t stop using whatsapp is because everyone is on it, akin to the same problem instagram suffers with.
If your friends and family use whatsapp, instagram and zuckbook, one must be mad to think of using an alternative.
Moreover, to succeed at bringing all your friends and family into a different platform is like compelling them to
the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those gotcha moments of the Zuck; a trap designed to chain your freedom. But if you are someone
who values privacy and respects yourself, I would suggest you to try Signal and encourage others to use it.
It is a better app for personal and intimate conversations with your friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple Vision Pro is Trash</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/apple-vision-pro/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had of something called a Bad Apple? Well you might be amazed to hear that all the normies have assembled together again to admire a new addition to their walled-garden, The all new VR Headset, or as apple
likes to call it their first &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;spatial computer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device is supposed to be put on your head so that you seamlessly switch between the physical and digital world. The best part about it is you can take it out after two minutes, because it is such a headache to have it on. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me, try putting a 500 gram object on your head - which will be lighter than this headset. it is just too unnecessary. they really expect people to keep wearing this like a bunch of zombies; And whenever they feel like activating their digital world, it is a button away, all of which is controlled by (you guessed it) &lt;em&gt;apple!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/normie-using-apple-vision-pro.png&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/&#34;&gt;Watch Full Video&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you cannot control though are apple&amp;rsquo;s innovative decisions. Rightfully so, they want their customers to have the best experience, and you trust them, right? Well then, you just need to pinch yourself, because what you are having is a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this new piece of tech is ridiculously priced, and isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the price. As the apple joke goes, one has to sell a kidney to buy their one product. But with &lt;em&gt;Apple Vision Pro&lt;/em&gt;, you would most likely have to sell both.&lt;/p&gt;
