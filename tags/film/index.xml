      <description>last thursday, i went to watch the socio-political action thriller, &amp;ldquo;Jawan&amp;rdquo;.
there were two compelling reasons i couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to miss this film: first, my unwavering admiration for the superstar Shah Rukh Khan, and second, my curiosity about the unique mummified look that had been teased.
apart from this, there was the film&amp;rsquo;s antagonist played by our very own Makkal Selvan, whose outstanding portrayal of &amp;ldquo;Michael Vedanayagam&amp;rdquo; in the web series Farzi had left a lasting impression on me.</description>
