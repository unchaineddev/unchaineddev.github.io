      <title>Two Phones, Too Much?</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/two-phones/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;When I was starting out as a working professional two years ago, I made a
pivotal decision that would redefine the way I interact with technologies. As a
privacy advocate and free software enthusiast, my aim was to reduce my reliance
on Google Services and other non-free software. This decision propelled me to
carry two phones to compartmentalize my online activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary phone is a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8, running LineageOS 18.1 and Android
11 (without Google Services). My work/non-free software running phone is a
Samsung M12 running Google Android 13 with OneUI version 5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/redmi-samsung.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought Redmi a couple of months before covid-19. I loved how it boasted an
impressive camera, long-lasting battery, in-fact it checked every box in
the features department. The catch-22 was the intrusive personalized
advertising and the burden of pre-installed bloatware on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, I switched to LineageOS because it offered a clean user
experience, particularly enjoying its UI. Additionally, it provided regular
security patches, a feature often lacking in the original MIUI. To this day, I
still receive security patches in lineageOS which is just awesome. The
trade-off sadly was a borked camera. * which I kind of got accustomed too :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I relied on my Samsung Google Android device, particularly
for financial transactions via UPI, using proprietary spyware like WhatsApp to
be a part of pointless groups, order food through Zomato/Swiggy, book Uber, or
engage in work activities such as checking mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst all of this, I was consciously using free and open source applications
(whenever possible) across both my devices. Some of them include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F-Droid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brave Browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KDE Connect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla Firefox (or any fork of it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signal Messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few Simple Mobile Tools applications - Contacts, Gallery, Dialer. ( do not
use it anymore since the apps are not open-source)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VLC Media Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram FOSS (fork)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having two phones offer some other advantages which I can appreciate. Firstly,
I won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about battery life. With two devices, I can distribute my
usage, lessening the strain on each battery. This ensures I always have a backup
available in case one device runs out of power. Also since I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly
fond of power banks, this setup suited me perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also prefer keeping my data locally rather than storing it in the cloud. So I
transitioned to storing all my media, documents, and important files on a hard
drive, with backups stored on my devices. This approach ensures my data is
easily accessible, under control and compartmentalized. This was perfect for
my threat modeling, however it does come at a cost of inconvenience. Carrying
two phones isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly comfortable, but it&amp;rsquo;s a compromise I&amp;rsquo;m willing to
make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I am glad to have made this decision, and I am grateful for the community
of developers and contributors who have built foss projects and made them
publicly available for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; as in &amp;lsquo;free speech,&amp;rsquo; not as in &amp;lsquo;free beer&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>xz has a secret backdoor</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/xz-backdoor/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;I already made a blog post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/archiving-files-using-tar/&#34; &gt;archiving files using
tar&lt;/a&gt; that covered gzip, a utility tool
to archive files with compression. In the same way, xz utils is an open-source
lossless data compression tool primarily focused on the &lt;strong&gt;.xz&lt;/strong&gt; file format,
suitable for archiving large amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately xz has been a victim to a highly sophisticated attack aimed at
injecting a secret backdoor, that resulted in compromise of numerous
distributions such as Debian, Kali, and openSUSE. This attack gave malicious
actors Remote Code Execution (RCE) privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily though, a Microsoft engineer Andres Freund discovered this issue by pure luck and
reported the issue when malicious code was found in a tar ball of liblzma (a library to implement compression).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malicious actor who signed the tarball was a long-standing contributor to
the project, who had built trust for years. While the original maintainer was
inactive in the project, this bad actor by the name &amp;ldquo;Jia Tan&amp;rdquo; earned the
community&amp;rsquo;s confidence through their positive contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves as a reminder to always do your due diligence,as &lt;em&gt;with great power
comes great responsibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook Intercepts Web Traffic</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/fb-intercepts-web-traffic/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In a newly disclosed court document,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it was revealed that Facebook launched
a secretive initiative called GhostBusters in the late 2010s, which could
intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat’s app
and its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enabled them to maintain a competitive advantage over other platforms,
primarily Snapchat, later followed with Youtube and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did they do this?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-did-they-do-this&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-did-they-do-this&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2010s, Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli-based VPN service and
mobile data analytics company known for data compression technology. This
innovative technology was used to mitigate high bandwidth usage due to the high
mobile data costs at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the acquision of this company, they integrated an advert on Facebook
called &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo;, which redirected users to download Onavo. Once this was
enabled, Facebook could easily track any application you use on your phone and
gather insightful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What now?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-now&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-now&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use any meta products, which sadly is the case nowadays, try to isolate
your environment. By isolating your browsing activities, you can better protect
your personal information and reduce the likelihood of being tracked or
targeted by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Signal Gets Usernames!</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Signal is a great messaging app for private digital communications. Features like end-to-end encryption,
privacy and security is time-tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction to usernames, exposure to phone numbers is minimal. It is a great feature
to have when you do not want to share your number with someone for a chat. The phone number is used
for sign up, however it will no longer be visible to everyone on Signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wonderful news for privacy and security enthusiasts, journalists, whistleblowers, and a big win
for digital freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Using Whatsapp</title>
      <link>https://unchaineddev.github.io/blog/stop-using-whatsapp/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 21:05:35 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to go against what is a lost cause. To tell someone to stop using whatsapp
in India is like ripping off their right to communicate freely. Nobody cares about privacy around here.
If someone likes me tells them their favorite messaging app is invasive, they tend to prompt questions that
imply I may have something to hide. Well in truth, Whatsapp is a closed-source, zuckbook-backed, data-mining company,
which in many ways is compromised. With this in mind, you cannot argue that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy
and it is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Snowden said it best: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Arguing that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy becaue you have nothing to hide is no different
than saying you don&amp;rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is worse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://whatsapp.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/a&gt; falsely claims to be a private messaging app, providing &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;end-to-end encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
to your messages. In reality, Whatsapp moderators&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; can read your messages, and they love to share your metadata
with law enforcement and other third-party companies, not only because it has to comply, or earn a profit, but to build
a relationship map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relationship map is an identity that can be derived from just who you associate with, which basically just
cancels out the encryption and privacy claim. One could argue that the constant lies is the problem, but you
need to ask yourself, if whatsapp was a person, would you trust it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun fact: The Zuck himself does not use whatsapp. Yet we Indians are accustomed to
&lt;em&gt;Good Morning&lt;/em&gt; texts and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;forwards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; that our minds have become numb, like the lizard person dumb
founded by gathering all that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree it is hard to break loose from this dopamine induced eco-system. After all, the primary reason why
people can&amp;rsquo;t stop using whatsapp is because everyone is on it, akin to the same problem instagram suffers with.
If your friends and family use whatsapp, instagram and zuckbook, one must be mad to think of using an alternative.
Moreover, to succeed at bringing all your friends and family into a different platform is like compelling them to
the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those gotcha moments of the Zuck; a trap designed to chain your freedom. But if you are someone
who values privacy and respects yourself, I would suggest you to try Signal and encourage others to use it.
It is a better app for personal and intimate conversations with your friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
