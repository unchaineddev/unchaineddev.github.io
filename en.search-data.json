I respect his achievements but a statement like this makes me want to question his intelligence or, take any of these wise old men seriously. His idea is if you want India to realize its economic potential every young Indian must say: “This is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week.” 1\nWell, you do not need to work 70 hours to realize its economic potential.2 Maybe he forgot the part where the quality of life also plays a crucial part in economic development? Maybe higher wages would help? I don’t know, I am no expert. Nonetheless for the sake of argument, let’s explore the numbers.\nAssuming a five-day work week, and subtracting 70 hours for work leaves out 50 hours.\nIf we allocate a bare minimum portion for essential activities like sleeping (averaging 8 hours a day) and meals (1.5 hours a day for three meals), we are left with barely a dozen hours.\nI have not included commuting, grooming or leisure time for that matter. it’s crucial to acknowledge that quality of life plays a significant role in economic development, which Murthy happily chose to ignore in his statement. Merely advocating for longer work hours without addressing other factors undermines overall well-being.\nOh, and the nationalist angle is ridiculous. for the sake of India, you cannot work 14 hours a day? Oh come on?! Where’s all the energy draining? Don’t you tell me you are working two jobs?? Oh right, that’s called moonlighting. Don’t do that, that’s unethical!

Take a currency note for instance. Did you ever reflect on the man behind the note? His truths, legacy, philosophy, or principles for that matter, that left an indelible mark on our history.\nToday, I want to share my review on Gandhi’s biography, “The Story Of My Experiments With Truth”. There are 5 parts in his book, and I will go over all the key learnings from the Mahatma himself.\nPart 1 - Early Life Gandhi was born in Porbandar to a devout Hindu family. His father, Karam Chand was an esteemed minister and his mother, Putlibai, a religious and an intelligent woman. It was from his mother Gandhi reveals, that shaped his spiritual beliefs in the years to come. He was married at the age of thirteen, a child marriage commonplace during the time that weighed heavily on his conscience. a bitter truth he remorsely conveys that cast a shadow on his understanding of personal freedom.\nThroughout the chapters of Part 1, Gandhi confesses his shy nature and the ingenious ways he overcame it. He was an introvert finding delight in books. While I was eagerly flipping through the pages, it was abundantly clear to me that Gandhi was exceptionally well-read. He devoured knowledge across diverse subjects. Religion, Vegetarianism, Philosophy, you name it. In the truest sense, he was honest unlike any other. It takes an honest man some grit to reveal to his readers his shortcomings. Our man does that throughout these pages. Starting with an incident in his school days, where he was (wait for it) accused of lying! He had skipped a gymnastics class to be a nurse to his sick father. He states that it was the last careless incident of his school days, however, not of his childhood days though.\nThere are moments in young Gandhi’s life filled with his share of regrets: first, of an incident where he secretly stole coppers from his servant’s pocket money to smoke cigarettes. Another of any ill-formed friendship; a friend whom his mother, elder brother and wife warned to stay away from. He reveals that the reason for being friends with his elder brother’s classmate was to “reform him”. Alas, his intent did not go as planned. Instead he was influenced by him to be a meat-eater. He conveys his regret on taking this path briefly, although I felt maybe it would make him physically stronger while fighting against the British later (hehe just kidding!).\nAfter his father’s demise, and completing of his matriculation, he was presented with an opportunity to study in England. It struck me that it was only a century ago when Gandhi set his sight on England, and his caste people were agitated for him moving abroad, entitling him as an outcast. This serves as a reminder of the fluid nature of societal perception. it is just a matter of time, like they say, for the perspective to evolve. So off goes the outcast, leaving his wife and his first born: To England.\nIn England at last, Gandhi shares his brief encounters with the cultural differences, immersing himself in studying law, learning how to be “an English Gentleman”, and exploring vegetarianism. a narrative that unfolded delightfully. One key thing in this part of the book that caught my intrigue was Gandhi’s habit of accounting. He tracked his expenses precisely and succeeded in exercising it with large amounts as well. This is one thing I feel we lack in the consumeristic culture we live in today.\nAlso, for my readers who work a corporate job, here is something that may or may not apply to you. The following lesson was given to Gandhi by a Mr. Mehta, verbatim the first lesson on European etiquette –\n‘Do not talk loudly, never address people “sir” whilst speaking to them, as we do in India; only servants and subordinates address theirs masters that way.’ In the context of working in a corporate job, it’s just bad practise to do that. if you are a fresh graduate, it should take you a while, but what I find madly preposterous is people with a work experience exceeding a culinary hen still address their senior management people as ‘sir\" even though they have asked them NOT to! (I can recall three instances as I write this when a senior manager asked people not to call him sir!)\nIt’s a mystery to me on what they achieve from the disrespect they give their senior management. If a person demands to be called sir, that’s another story. You can ruffle their feathers nonetheless. Why? Because calling someone sir* is awkward, and outdated to say the least. However, I digress.\n* on circumstance of a corporate job. the usage on other places is debatable, yet I feel it polite only when you do not know a person’s name for instance. (totally avoidable though!)\nPart 2 - Experience in Africa In the annals of history, Gandhi’s encounter with racism in South Africa remains a poignant chapter. In this section of the book, he shares his experience at length about being ejected out of his first-class passenger seat, his battle against color prejudice and racism, his Christian contacts whose support helped him deeply in his quest for finding God and spiritual enlightenment.\nTo acquire true knowledge, Gandhi says, one must have a guru. a mentor to mold one’s progress and self-growth. A result of which yields a moral standing and strength. He pays tribute to Raychandbhai, who taught him the importance of self-discipline and truthfulness to Gopal Krishna Gokhale’s influence that shaped his political activism. Additionally, he speaks of other notable figures namely Leo Tolstoy, whose prose had influenced his view of the world profoundly.\nSpeaking of, I think finding the right Guru is a challenge. While one may lack the knowledge in a particular field, another would be too occupied to fulfill their own responsibilities. I think of it as a good thing though. In today’s digital age, there is a wealth of information you can acquire on the internet. The goal should be in this long walk, a constant strive for self-improvement.\nAnother thing to note is that Gandhi’s prose is deeply personal. If you delve into his work, it is close to impossible to not be affected by it. I must say, our hero was without a question an imperfect man. Despite all of this, his truths continue to resonate within us, a testament to his enduring power of prose.\nHis influence is far-fetched akin to the arms of a bapu, literally. In Africa, He unites all the Indians under a sole cause: Fair Treatment. It was indeed the rise of Mahatma Gandhi, not just as a political leader, but the voice for the voiceless. A public service barrister. In his own words, and I quote, “To find the better side of human nature, a lawyer must unite parties, river asunder.”\nPart 3 - His Philosophy Gandhi’s self-reliant nature is possibly what I admire most about the man. His ability to perform tasks like washing his own clothes or cutting his own hair. It came at the cost of ridicule, yet his determination was unhindered.\nWhile he stayed with Gokhale, he learns of the dedication required to do public service, and how his hectic schedule restrained him from taking long walks or exercise. He thus emphasizes the reader to prioritize one’s health and well-being. This one I liked too.\nHowever, there are some aspects of his philosophy that I find unnecessary. For instance, he believes, vows don’t close the door to freedom but open them. And caring for children is inconsistent (more on this later) with doing public work, which again is quite the contrary.\nWhen faced with adversity, Gandhi doesn’t succumb. He recounts a tough moment when his son, Manilal fell ill, and the doctor prescribed eggs and chicken broth, which is contrary to Gandhi’s vegetarianism principles. This situation truly tested his conviction. Nevertheless, Gandhi perseveres and sticks to his values, and cares for his son, leaving no stone unturned.\nI beleive in a balanced diet. In fact I encourage cooked green vegetables as an essential in your meal. I say this, for Gandhi advocates self-control in every aspect, including diet. According to him, control of the palate – simple, spiceless, and uncooked foods – to restrain the senses and passions of life. I disagree with this perspective for the most part. It reminds me of a quote from one of my favorite authors of the 19th century.\n“The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.”\nI find some of these teachings for the modern life challenging, and I daresay unrealistic for everyone. Everyone. for a great man like Gandhi, it’s a breeze.\nAnother aspect of Gandhi’s principle I can appreciate and encourage though, is his emphasis on cleanliness and sanitation. Despite his efforts on hygiene on third-class passenger trains or places of the divine, the reality even today is far from ideal. He proposes solutions, yet the unsanitary habits we have accustomed ourselves with is disheartening. It is nothing, but a lost cause. From my experience nothing much has changed.\nPart 4 \u0026 5 – soon.\nQuote of the month I have nothing new to teach the world, Truth and non-violence are as old as the hills.

I wouldn’t call it a revolutionary product per se, as phone manufacturers already bundle their own app stores on their phones.\nIt is good news for developers though, as there is 0% commission on in-app subscriptions and low fees in comparison to the Google Play Store. As a consumer, to use Indus App Store since it is a “Make in India” product does not cut it for me.

With this in mind, you cannot argue that you don’t care about privacy and it is stupid.\nEdward Snowden said it best: “Arguing that you don’t care about privacy becaue you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say”\nWhat is worse? Whatsapp falsely claims to be a private messaging app, providing end-to-end encryption to your messages. In reality, Whatsapp moderators1 can read your messages, and they love to share your metadata with law enforcement and other third-party companies, not only because it has to comply, or earn a profit, but to build a relationship map.\nA relationship map is an identity that can be derived from just who you associate with, which basically just cancels out the encryption and privacy claim. One could argue that the constant lies is the problem, but you need to ask yourself, if whatsapp was a person, would you trust it?\nHere’s a fun fact: The Zuck himself does not use whatsapp. Yet we Indians are accustomed to Good Morning texts and “forwards” that our minds have become numb, like the lizard person dumb founded by gathering all that data.\nI agree it is hard to break loose from this dopamine induced eco-system. After all, the primary reason why people can’t stop using whatsapp is because everyone is on it, akin to the same problem instagram suffers with. If your friends and family use whatsapp, instagram and zuckbook, one must be mad to think of using an alternative. Moreover, to succeed at bringing all your friends and family into a different platform is like compelling them to the dance floor.\nThis is one of those gotcha moments of the Zuck; a trap designed to chain your freedom. But if you are someone who values privacy and respects yourself, I would suggest you to try Signal and encourage others to use it. It is a better app for personal and intimate conversations with your friends and family.\nhttps://gizmodo.com/whatsapp-moderators-can-read-your-messages-1847629241 ↩︎"},"title":"Stop Using Whatsapp"},"/blog/support-for-palestine/":{"data":{"":"All the big news organizations are known for manipulating facts and having biased opinions. If you think there are not taking a side, you are overly optimistic. Moreover, relying on a for-profit major news organizations is akin to burying one’s head in the sand and trusting whatever information comes along. It is a no-brainer. Their support for Israel makes it even more clear of their ignorance. More civilians are killed by Israel and they will never show you that.\nAn eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. They will never tell you Hamas is NOT Palestine.\nIn addition to news organizations, there are a certain “smart” people which I have found myself losing a lot of respect for. Despite their extensive knowledge in their respective fields, it’s disheartening to see they do not see the bigger picture and prioritize personal interests over basic human rights.\nTheir unwavering support for Israel is crystal clear that they cannot be trusted. It is disturbing to see their indifference towards the consequences of Israeli actions on Palestinian civilians, especially considering that over half of the population comprises children.\nGenerally I oppose the use of social media, however in a time like this, people who actively use it must not remain silent on such matters, considering how swiftly people post about trending topics. It’s crucial to recognize that silence can inadvertently contribute to the perpetuation of hatred. If it does not happen to you, that doesn’t mean you need to turn a blink eye, and that is the message of this blog.\nSocial tensions after World War II convinced the “Zionist Jews” that they need their own country.1. 20 years later, here’s how Palestine occupied area looks like: Albert Einstein on Palestine: 2\n“I am in favor of Palestine being developed as a Jewish Homeland but not as a separate state. It seems to me a matter of simple common sense that we cannot ask to be given political rule over Palestine where two thirds of the population are not Jewish.”\n– January 19, 1946\nMany Jews (except the Zionists)3 are still of the opinion to free Palestine and to live in peace with each other.4\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080016/israel-zionism-war-1948 ↩︎\nhttps://countercurrents.org/2023/10/einstein-cited-equally-horrific-terrorist-massacre-of-arabs-usa-origin-of-killing-in-palestine/ ↩︎\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/19/jewish-protest-israel-gaza-washington-dc ↩︎\nhttps://www.annefrank.org/en/topics/antisemitism/are-all-jews-zionists/ ↩︎"},"title":"In Support for Palestine"},"/braindump/":{"data":{"":"all my braindumps are listed here.\n06-03-2024 — Signal Gets Usernames! 17-02-2024 — Best Way to Download Youtube Videos 11-02-2024 — How to check CPU Usage in the Terminal? 09-01-2024 — Ram’s Wise Mind 17-11-2023 — json.dumps vs json.loads 02-10-2023 — Activate Virtual Environments in Powershell 11-09-2023 — setting up proxies (IP authentication) with Selenium and Python "},"title":"Braindump"},"/braindump/cpu-usage-terminal/":{"data":{"":"","#":"I like to optimize my system’s performance and like it even more if the cpu usage is at the bare minimum.
