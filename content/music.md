This is a compiled list of my absolute favorites. Whether you're craving something fresh, or downright extraordinary, my playlist has got you covered. 

*Life is for the living. Death is for the dead.*
\
*Let life be like music. And death a note unsaid.*



### <u>Sounds of Silence</u>

-- If I mention S&G, most draw a blank face with an intrigue to know more. The moment I quote, "_Hello darkness, my old friend.._" it's like a lightbulb moment â€“ everyone gets it. 



### <u>Me Against The World</u>

-- What sets 2Pac apart from others is that he carries an unmatched resonance. His music is deeply personal, poetic and lyrical.

-- A lyrical genius. I won't be suprised if people have listened to this entire album without realizing it.
